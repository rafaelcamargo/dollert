Dollert is a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dollert/lkbhlmhaiggihoihajncjlnmbpigbkam) to help people who often need to know the current price of USD in BRL. So, the solution was create a little application that accepts expected prices for USD and, in case of USD price to reach the expected price in BRL, a desktop notification is fired.
